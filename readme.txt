I created this application using Spring boot with kotlin and using MongoDB as database.
i Used mongodb because for me it was the easiest way to create a database fast.
To run this app you should go to the BankApplication.kt and run the main method, ity should launch a server.
You must have installed mongoDB and a database named Bank, and do a get request to the "/test" service, so it get fulfilled with some data.
All te information relative to the database conection must be in application.properties, (don't forget to put the security on in mongodb)
Greetings!
